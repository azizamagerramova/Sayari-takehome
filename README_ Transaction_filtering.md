# Frontend Changes Guide

This short guide explains what I changed in the **TransactionTable** and **TransactionDetails** components, why I changed it, and how to exercise the new features.

---

## TL;DR

- **TransactionTable**: fixed data mapping issues and wired live updates from the socket so totals increment when new transactions arrive.
- **TransactionDetails**: implemented client-side filtering (search, date-time range, min/max amount), sorting, pagination that respects filters, live updates via socket, a record counter, and a clear-filters control.

---

## Files changed

- `frontend/src/components/TransactionTable.tsx`  
  _Summary table of businesses with industries and total transaction counts._

- `frontend/src/components/transactions/TransactionDetails.tsx`  
  _Detailed transactions table with filtering & search._

---

## TransactionTable: what changed & why

### 1) Correctly enrich businesses with transaction counts

- **Bug fixed**: transaction count response shape.
  - **Before**: code tried to read `countData.transactionCount`
  - **After**: the response is read as `countData.data.transactionCount`, and we default to `0` if missing.
  - Resulting `Business` now reliably has `totalTransactions`.

### 3) Live updates via socket

- Subscribes to `graphUpdate`. When a new transaction arrives, we increment the `totalTransactions` for the impacted businesses.
- **Important note**: events carry **names** (not business IDs). The update now compares against `business.name` for accuracy.

#### Suggestions for future polish

- Use business ids rather than names when subscribing to `graphUpdate`

---

## TransactionDetails: what changed & why

### 1) Client‑side filtering & search

- **Search**: `name` matches **both** `from` and `to` names (case-insensitive).
- **Date/time range**: two pickers (`start`, `end`) filter records inclusively; uses Day.js via MUI X.
- **Amount range**: `min`/`max` numeric filters.
- **Counter**: shows `filtered / total` records to give immediate feedback.
- **Clear Filters**: one click resets all filters and returns to page 0.

### 2) Sorting & pagination

- Column-based sorting with `TableSortLabel` for `timestamp`, `from`, `to`, `amount`.
- Pagination is applied **after** filtering and sorting, so it always reflects the current view.

### 3) Live updates via socket

- On `graphUpdate.newTransaction`, the new transaction is unshifted onto the list; if it matches active filters, it appears immediately.
- Recently arrived item is briefly highlighted (CSS class `new-transaction-row`).

### 4) Performance & safety

- All filter computations are wrapped in `useMemo`, recalculating only when inputs change.
- Defensive parsing for numbers and dates: invalid inputs won’t crash the UI; they simply don’t filter.

#### Suggestions for future polish

- Consider debouncing the search field for very large data sets.
- Persist filters in the URL query (e.g., `?q=acme&min=100`) to preserve state across refreshes.
- For very large datasets, switch to server-side filtering via the existing `/api/transactions/filter` endpoint and reuse the same UI.

## How to use

1. **TransactionTable (summary)**

   - Open the Summary view; businesses should appear sorted by total transactions.
   - Generate mock transactions (via the backend endpoints) and watch totals increment in near-real time.

2. **TransactionDetails (details)**
   - Type a business name in search; the table filters immediately.
   - Set a `Start` and `End` datetime to restrict the range.
   - Enter `Min amount`/`Max amount` to filter by value.
   - Observe the `filtered / total` counter and pagination updating accordingly.
   - Clear filters to reset.

---

## Implementation notes

- **Date-time pickers**: uses MUI X DateTimePicker (`@mui/x-date-pickers`) with Day.js; wraps the app with:
  ```tsx
  <LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDayjs}>
    {/* app */}
  </LocalizationProvider>
  ```
- **Sockets**: both components subscribe to the shared socket via `getSocket()` and listen for `graphUpdate` events.
- **Env**: both fetchers rely on `VITE_API_URL` (fallback `http://localhost:3000`).

---

## Known limitations

- **Name-based matching** for socket updates in `TransactionTable`: if business names are not unique, counts may increment for multiple rows. Ideally events should include a stable `business_id`.
- **Client-side filtering**: fine for modest data sizes. For large datasets, move filtering to the server or implement virtualized rows (e.g., `react-window`).

---

## Test plan (manual)

- Load Summary: verify initial sort on `Total Transactions` (desc) and working pagination.
- Start the mock generator: see `TransactionTable` totals increment.
- Open Details: verify search, date range, and min/max filters all work and update the count.
- While filters are active, send a new transaction via socket; if it matches the filters, it should appear.
- Sort by each column and confirm ascending/descending behavior.

## Appendix: dependencies

- `@mui/material`, `@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled`
- `@mui/x-date-pickers` and `dayjs` (for the Details date pickers)
